# Testing Coverage Strategy

## Current Coverage Status

### Client Application

- **Current Coverage**: ~8-10% (initial baseline)
- **Target Coverage Goals**:
  - Lines: 25%
  - Functions: 25%
  - Branches: 20%
  - Statements: 25%

### Server Application

- **Current Coverage**: ~19-20% (initial baseline)
- **Target Coverage Goals**:
  - Lines: 25%
  - Functions: 25%
  - Branches: 20%
  - Statements: 25%

## Test Infrastructure

### Unit Tests

- **Client**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Server**: Jest + Supertest
- **Setup**: Comprehensive mocking for WebSocket, DOM APIs, and external services

### Integration Tests

- **API Testing**: Supertest with database integration
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with test migrations

### End-to-End Tests

- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Basic user workflows and visual regression testing

### Performance Tests

- **Tool**: Lighthouse CI
- **Metrics**: Core Web Vitals, accessibility, SEO

## Coverage Strategy

### Phase 1 (Current - Baseline)

- Establish testing infrastructure
- Set realistic initial coverage targets (20-25%)
- Focus on critical path testing

### Phase 2 (Next Sprint)

- Increase coverage to 40-50%
- Add more component and hook tests
- Improve API endpoint coverage

### Phase 3 (Future)

- Achieve 70-80% coverage for critical code paths
- Comprehensive edge case testing
- Performance optimization testing

## Key Testing Areas

### High Priority (Must Test)

1. **AppContext and state management**
2. **API client and error handling**
3. **WebSocket connections**
4. **Technical indicators calculations**
5. **Chart rendering components**

### Medium Priority

1. **Form validations**
2. **Authentication flows**
3. **Drawing tools**
4. **Trading simulations**

### Low Priority

1. **Static UI components**
2. **Utility functions**
3. **Type definitions**

## Quality Gates

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Unit tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- E2E tests must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Security scans must pass

### Coverage Enforcement

- Vite configuration enforces client coverage thresholds
- Jest configuration enforces server coverage thresholds
- GitHub Actions fails builds if coverage drops below targets

## Testing Best Practices

### Unit Tests

- Mock external dependencies
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Group related tests with describe blocks

### Integration Tests

- Test complete API workflows
- Use test database with proper cleanup
- Verify database state changes
- Test authentication and authorization

### E2E Tests

- Focus on critical user journeys
- Use Page Object Model pattern
- Include visual regression testing
- Test responsive design

### Performance Tests

- Monitor Core Web Vitals
- Set performance budgets
- Test on various network conditions
- Measure bundle size impact

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Review

- Weekly coverage reports
- Monthly test strategy review
- Quarterly performance benchmarking

### Metrics to Track

- Test execution time
- Coverage percentage by module
- Test reliability (flakiness)
- Performance regression detection

### Tools and Automation

- Automated coverage reporting
- Visual regression testing
- Performance monitoring
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Getting Started

### Running Tests

```bash
# Client unit tests with coverage
pnpm --filter @trading-viewer/client test:unit --coverage

# Server unit tests with coverage
pnpm --filter @trading-viewer/server test:unit --coverage

# E2E tests
pnpm --filter @trading-viewer/client test:e2e

# All tests
pnpm test
```

### Coverage Reports

- HTML reports generated in `coverage/` directories
- Coverage data sent to Codecov in CI
- Lighthouse reports for performance metrics

This strategy provides a solid foundation for maintaining and improving code quality through comprehensive testing.
